		<h1> Race is Still Alive</h1>
<p> Race, and more importantly, racism, is still seen in today's society. People of color are often degraded on a national level. They are not given the same opportunities as their white counterpart. When the odds are stacked against them, it is less likely that POC succeed in the US.</p>
        <h2> Treatment of POC in the US</h2>
<p>People of color are not treated equally in the US, even today. Racism is still a problem that many young Americans face, whether it be blatant, or through micro-aggressions. In the news, people of color are reduced to their stereotypes when found guilty of a crime, and the use of language against them is always negative. Most times, that same language is used to represent the whole racial group instead of the individual. </p>
<h3>Treatment of Black people</h3>
        	<p>Since the end of the Civil Rights Era, most people thought the US would move into a "post-racial" America,   but that was not the case. Black people were systematically targeted, and put in jail as a form of regression. White people did not like the fact that black people were progressing, so as a way to stop that, <i>mass incarceration </i>became a way to keep black people locked up. Even now, black people are 7 times more likely to be put in jail than white people. Along with that, Black women make 60 cents to every white man's dollar. <img class="top" src="Photos/black-lives-matter.jpg" width="400" height="225">
           
<h3 class="asian">Treatment of Asians</h3>
<p>The affects of the way Asians were treated historically still linger on. When Asians are not being called the "model-minorities", the idea that Asians are the best of all minorities with stereotypes like being smart, they are called racial slurs. Often times people mimic their accents or ask seem surprised that they speak English at all, implying that they are not originally from here, or that they should return to their own country.</p>
            <h3>Treatment of Arabs</h3>
<p>Most Arabs, whether they are Muslim or not, are linked with the religion. Since 9/11, Arabs have been a target for religious hate crimes. Arabs are often called terrorists, and these micro-aggressions make it hard for them to live normal everyday lives.</p>

            <h3>Treatment of Mexicans</h3>
<p>Mexican and other Latino-Americans suffer from discrimination and targeting, especially in the topic of immigration. Many families have been torn apart due to immigration, and because of tight policies, it is hard for undocumented students to find jobs, or go to college. Along with that, Latina women make 54 cents to the white man's dollar.</p>
	
<p> Part of the reason why these injustices still exist is because of the white system, which was built by white people to help other white people, and keep POC down. This is also known as white privilege.</p>
<h2>White Privilege</h2>
<p>The idea of white privilege in America (and other nations dominated by white people) emerged from the idea that the dominant racial group enjoys unearned and unacknowledged advantages just by being part of the dominant group. U.S. colonies, rich white people had to constantly put down rebellion and protest by poor black and white people (the former were slaves, the latter were indentured laborers). To undermine this solidarity, rich landowners engaged in a divide and conquer tactic. They co-opted poor white people on the basis of “race” – saying that rich or poor, white people had to stick together. The rich white people sweetened the deal by giving poor white people some perks: land and acceptance into “whiteness” and the privileges that went with being white in America. <br>
            white privilege is analogous to gender privilege. Men in society enjoy certain privileges – higher average pay for similar work, for example – because they belong to a particular gender group. Whites enjoy privilege because they belong to a certain racial group. One interesting aspect about the men-women dynamic is that men are often willing to admit that women are disadvantaged economically by their gender status, but men are often not willing to admit they are over-privileged because of their gender status. And it is the same for race: White people are willing to admit that minorities in America are disadvantaged in many realms of life but are less willing to admit that they have unearned advantages simply because they are identified as white. <br>
white people are socialized to not recognize white privilege. White privilege is like a passport that helps white people navigate through society relatively more easily that non-whites. But most whites do not even “see” their privilege let alone question it. This “blindness” is not willful, conscious, intentional or malicious – it is simply that most whites have not had to think about it (which is another privilege). If you are at the top of the racial hierarchy, you do not question why you are there – you just are. It is like a fish in a fish tank: you don’t question the surrounding water, it is just normal. </p>

	<p class="nut"> An example of white privileged on campus is the incident involving the noose during a football game. The students in question received warning, got their season passes revoked, and the general body received an email about freedom of speech. This action was considered hate speech by the students of color on campus, but there was no more punishment for the students who committed the crime.</p><br>
