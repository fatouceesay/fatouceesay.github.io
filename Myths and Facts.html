        <h1>Myths and Facts<h1>
        <img src="Photos/Screen-Shot-2015-06-30-at-2.42.31-PM.png" width="300" height="173">
        <h2>Myth #1: Race and ethnicity are the same thing. </h2>
        <p>Fact: Race is the catergorization of people based on physical traits while ethnicity is the division of people into smaller groups based on similar values, behavioral patterns, language, political and economic interests, history and ancestral geographical base.   </p>
        
        <h2>Myth #2: Race in not a real problem anymore. </h2>
        <p>Fact: Race is still one of the most imporatnt issues in the US. There is a lot of tension between races, especially after Donald Trump's win. People face racial prejudice everyday.</p>
        
        <h2>Myth #3: People of color can be racist (reverse racism). </h2>
       <p> Fact: Reverse racism is not real. The idea of racism is rooted in the fact that in order to be racist, you must hold a certain power over the person you're being racist to. Because white people ultimately hold the most power (white males specifically), they can be racist. However, people of color can still be prejudiced towards any other group of people.</p>  
        
        <h2>Myth #4: Colorblindness is a form of acceptance.</h2>
        <p>Fact: Colorblindness is the act of not seeing race. This would be acceptable if race weren't real in it's consequences, but it is. Colorblindness completely ignores the struggles that people of color have faced. Although the intention is to look at a person as more than just their race, a person's race is so engrained into their expereicnes that it is contradictory to ignore someone's race.   </p>
        
        <h2>Myth #5: Race is only a black and white thing. </h2>
        <p>Fact: It becomes difficult to talk about the racial struggles between other race groups because of the violent history of black and white people. However, there are other violent histories between white people and other racial groups, and when discussing racism, it's important to discuss racist acts on Latinos, Asians, Native Americans, and other races. </p> 
        
        <h2>Myth #6: There is unity between each race group</h2>
        <p>Fact: In any racial group, tehre is prejudice and discrimination. Whether that be because of colorism, culture, or class, there are always problems between people. </p> 
        
        <h2>Myth #7: There are distinct lines about a person and their race </h2>
       <p> Fact: There are not only 5 races in the world. Many people might identify someone as a Latino, and that person may identify as an Afro-Latino. Race is a very ambigious term, and many times when trying to properly identify a person, it's best to just ask them how they identify themselves. </p>
        
        <h2>Myth #8: Hollywood is very diverse </h2>
        <p>Fact: Although the US population for people of color is around 47%, actors and actresses of color in Hollywood only make up about 17%. Often time when they are casted, they are the supporting cast, never the main character. Or, if they are the main character, they are playing out a stereotype that has no real depth. In addition, when the film revolves around a race, many times the protagonist is a white man trying to "save them". Also, whitewashing a real problem in Hollywood. Instead of giving roles to talented actors and actresses who should be playing a character, casting directors give the role to white actors and actresses, completely stripping the character of their racial background. </p>
        
        <h2>Myth #9: This campus is diverse and not racist </h2>
       <p> Fact: This campus is incredibly racist, and a perfect example of that is the incident involving the noose at a football game. While the administrators are interested in keeping people of color happy, they are more interested in keeping investors, shareholders, and alumni (who are mostly white) happy. This campus is a business first, and an educational institution second. Along with that incident, there was another incident involving a frat on Langdon that hung a black figure outside of their house a coupple of years ago, resembling a lynching. The frat later got a citation. </p>  
        
        <h2>Myth #10: Allies can't be racist </h2> 
        <p>Fact: Allies ultimately hold a certain privilege over the community they are not a part of. Their job is to speak up when needed, and never over. Sometimes allies do not understand this, and don't listen to the group they're trying to help. This happens when they let their own previous stereotypes get in the way of learning. These people are not actual allies. Allyship is not a noun, but a verb.  </p>
