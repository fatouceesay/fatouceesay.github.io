            <h1>What is race?</h1>
   				<img src="Photos/race.jpg" width="200" height="276"><p>Race is the classification of human beings into categories based on physical characteristics. There are many different views of race, but the two main views are the Social Construct View and the Scientific view:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Social Construct View:</b> The idea of race is a product of human choices and history rather than something rooted primarily in nature, genetics, or biology. We invent racial categories, we apply those categories to people and there are social implications to belonging in those categories. When people are assigned to such categories, it is the called the act of socialization, and over time, these sociological decisions and actions may seem like they were always there – as given or natural – rather than social constructions.<br></li>
                
                <li><b>Scientific View:</b> During the mid-19th century, when the Enlightenment was in full bloom, many otherwise ambiguous theories were challenged by the scientific idea. One of these theories included race, which was now e explained by the science of genetics. The scientific view claimed that because the differences were biological, they were bound to be permanent and persistent. Race was assigned based on arbitrary characteristics such as skin color. Though the viewpoint has been largely discredited, it has not disappeared. In 1994, the book the Bell<i> Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life</i> made controversial claims that black people were inherently less intelligent than white people.<br></li>      
                </ul>
       
        	<h2>Who does race affect?</h2>
        		<p>Race affects everyone. In the United States, every person is first categorized by their race. When applying for jobs, Identification, even when applying to college, all applications require you provide your race. Although it is largely accepted that race is a social construct, and therefore not real, it is real in the consequences towards People of Color (POC). POC have always been treated differently because of their physical or cultural differences. Even in today's society, there is discrimination of minorities all across the nation. Many times white people attribute this to the behaviors of the victims, and fail to realize that they hold a certain privilege that POC can never have. </p>
