        <h1> How can I learn more?</h1>
        	<p> All of the information I got for this website was from an online class I took this semester, Journalism 162: Mass Media in Multicultural America. I would recommend taking this course if you want to learn more. Also, you can always just educate yourself! It's really easy, since you probably have access to the internet, and it's a fulfilling feeling when you learn something yourself.</p>
            <p> Another class you can take is called Intercultural Dialogues (ICD), which I also took this semester. The class spends the semester discussing various social movements, and marginalized groups, such as people of color, disabled people, transgendered people, and more. Below is a video we created this semester to highlight the class!</p>
